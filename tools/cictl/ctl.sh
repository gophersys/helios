# tools/cictl/ctl.sh — control script for cictl, the Eden CI contract tool
# (go-first-emit). cictl emits the CI contract's JSON Schema from Go structs,
# validates an instance, renders the provider workflows deterministically,
# drift-checks them (the CI-on-CI gate), asserts a repo's .ci/ is canonical,
# lists affected project roots, and reports the pinned-version matrix.
#
# Usage: ./ctl.sh <command> [args...]
#
# Verbs are uniform with the monorepo's nx:run-commands convention: project.json
# targets are thin wrappers that delegate here, so a consumer can invoke
# `nx run cictl:test` without reading source.
