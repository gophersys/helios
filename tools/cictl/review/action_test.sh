# review/action_test.sh — prove that the review composite action says what it
# must, and that every one of those assertions can fail.
#
# `review/action.yml` is the ONE home of the review job for every gophersys
# repository: each of the others holds a ~25-line GENERATED caller that carries
# no logic. So a defect here reaches all of them at once, and a check on this
# action that cannot fail protects none of them.
#
# This file replaces the suite that guarded `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`,
# the reusable workflow that is now RETIRED. That workflow's whole safety rested
# on `github.job_workflow_sha`, which is EMPTY inside a called workflow, so its
# pin could never resolve (ledger #46). A composite action needs no pin guard at
# all: the runner checks this repository out at the caller's `uses:` ref, so the
# source on disk IS the pinned commit. What replaces the pin test is therefore a
# test that nothing here FETCHES — the moment the action reaches for code that is
# not beside it, the ref stops being the pin.
#
# The suite runs in the same 3 phases as review/review_test.sh:
#
#   phase 1   behaviour      — every test must PASS against the real tree.
#   phase 1b  control        — the same tests against an unmutated COPY of the
#                              tree must reach the same verdicts. A test that
#                              answers differently on a copy was decided by the
#                              copy and not by the tree, and phase 2 would then
#                              prove nothing.
#   phase 2   discrimination — for each test, apply each counter-stimulus to a
#                              copy of the tree and require that same test to
#                              FAIL. A test that still passes proves nothing,
#                              and this suite exits non-zero when that happens.
#
# Nothing here runs an action: GitHub runs actions. What this reads is the action
# definition, the scripts it dispatches to, the repository those scripts point
# into, the caller the generator actually emits, and what a real workflow linter
# says about it. `actionlint` is required, never optional — neither yq nor a YAML
# library reports a duplicate mapping key, they silently keep the last one, and a
# duplicated `timeout-minutes` is the defect that produced startup failures with
# NO check attached to the pull request in 3 repositories.
#
# Usage: bash review/action_test.sh [test-name ...]   # no names = every test
