# review/review_test.sh — prove that every guard in review/review.sh can fail.
#
# review.sh spawns a paid agent and writes to a pull request. Almost all of its
# value is in what it REFUSES to do, so this suite runs in 2 phases:
#
#   phase 1  behaviour — every test must PASS against the real review.sh.
#   phase 2  mutation  — for each test, delete the 1 line that holds the guard
#                        which that test covers, then require the same test to
#                        FAIL. A test that still passes proves nothing, and this
#                        suite exits non-zero when that happens.
#
# Nothing here touches the network and nothing spends money. PATH is replaced by
# a sandbox that holds stub `claude` and `gh` commands plus the small set of
# coreutils that review.sh needs. The real `claude` and `gh` are unreachable by
# construction, not by convention.
