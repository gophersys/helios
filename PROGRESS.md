## Current Phase: ALL PHASES COMPLETE — rebased to KiCad 10 (2026-07-30)

**1005 tests passing. 110 projects parsed. 343 clean IC families. Real multi-pin symbols for ESP32/STM32. 0 ERC errors. Full manufacturing pipeline (BOM/CPL/Gerber/Drill/STEP/VRML).**

### KiCad 10 rebase (branch feat/kicad10-rebase, 2026-07-30)
- [x] Full suite validated against kicad-cli 10.0.4 on macOS (all prior failures were missing gitignored data, not KiCad 10)
- [x] Tests resolve kicad-cli from PATH (was hardcoded /usr/bin from devcontainer)
- [x] kiutils Fix 7: KiCad 10 boards drop the numbered net table — pads use name-only `(net "GND")`; Net.from_sexpr now accepts both forms (+4 tests, equivalence-verified vs KiCad 9 parse of same board)
- [x] KiCad 10 files verified end-to-end: flat + hierarchical schematics upgraded via `kicad-cli sch upgrade` round-trip 37/37 and 131/131 vs kicad-cli 10 netlists
- [x] Devcontainer bumped to KiCad 10 PPA
- [x] Pilot restore fixed: bitcraze/crazyflie2-pcb removed upstream → crazyflie-electronics; dumbpad + VESC-controller added to clone_pilots.sh (test dependencies)
- [x] Finding: kicad-cli 10 refuses paltatech VESC-controller's 20170922-format board ("Failed to load board", `pcb upgrade` also fails) while v9 loaded it and even (version 4)/2016 boards still load — narrow legacy-dialect regression; 3D-export tests now use dumbpad as second project
### ecad rework (2026-07-30, PRs #2/#3 + feat/layout-engine)
- [x] Phase A: typed design model (src/ecad) — Component/Pin/Net/Design + unified SymbolModel; 26 adversarial-review findings fixed
- [x] Phase B: footprint index/resolver (15k installed footprints) + official-symbol ingestion with extends-resolution
- [x] Phase C: layout engine — graph_build/rank/order/place/route/engine/lints; hard gates green (ERC 0, netlist == intended, geometric lints, byte-determinism); found+fixed latent unloadable-lib_symbols bug (lib-prefixed child names)
- [x] Pure emitters extracted to src/ecad/emit.py (pipeline→ecad layering enforced); CI added (.github/workflows/ci.yml); docs/ecad-architecture.md
- [x] Stage 1 de-legacy (branch feat/de-legacy): legacy-parity tests replaced by golden-file snapshots (tests/ecad/golden/, byte-exact, 3 registry chips); deleted _generate_symbol_legacy + _generate_lib_symbol_sexp_legacy + 4 orphaned symbol_gen helpers; chip_library factories/lookup_chip kept as data (seed the factory until Phase D). datasheet_parser fallbacks + to_inline_sexp/flatten single-unit path deliberately left (Stage 2/3 ordering)
- [ ] Phase D: ingestion factory (datasheet ∥ Zephyr ∥ crossverify ∥ codegen) + Espressif seed + COMPONENTS.md loop
- [x] Phase E: composer migration onto Design→layout→emit (branch feat/composer-migration-wf1): compose_design builds a typed src.ecad Design per sheet (power/mcu/per-peripheral), the layout engine places+routes+emits each one, and the root sheet wires its sheet pins so the hierarchy really connects. Deleted every hardcoded coordinate, `Custom:` 2-pin stub and empty IC footprint on that path. Part resolution = generated registry → seed chip_library → warned `Unverified:<part>` placeholder. Gates per project: geometric lint clean, kicad-cli loads each sub-sheet, project ERC errors == 0, exported netlist == `Design.intended_netlist()` (MCU sheet checked separately for the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 + NEO-6M GPS tracker), byte-determinism. Engine gained `label_anchors()`, `emit(hier_labels=, flag_rails=)`; fixed two engine bugs found on the way (single-port nets were dropped by the router; middle caps of a satellite rail row had no junction dot). Known gap: a sub-sheet ERC'd ALONE reports hierarchical-label + undriven-rail errors by construction — the project-level ERC is the oracle

- [ ] Follow-up: replace hand-rolled manufacturing exports with kicad-cli 10 jobsets (works as-is; refactor is optional code-deletion, not a fix)
- [ ] Follow-up: use `kicad-cli sch/pcb upgrade` (new in 10) as the corpus ingest normalizer — removes the old "open in GUI to convert" constraint from docs/thesis.md §4

## How To Continue (for autonomous loop)

1. Read this file to determine current phase and next incomplete task
2. Check if tests exist and are passing: `cd ~/hardware && python3 -m pytest tests/ -v 2>&1 | tail -20`
3. If tests are failing, fix the code until they pass
4. If all tasks in current phase are complete, move to next phase
5. Mark completed tasks with [x] in this file
6. Commit progress: `cd ~/hardware && git add -A && git commit -m "progress: <what was done>"`
7. If stuck on something, document the blocker in a BLOCKERS section at the bottom
8. Key files:
   - Architecture spec: docs/parser-architecture.md
   - Thesis/research: docs/thesis.md
   - Vendored kiutils: tools/kiutils/
   - Pipeline code: src/pipeline/
   - Tests: tests/
   - Pilot data: data/raw/ (10 pilot + 100 bulk cloned KiCad projects)
   - kicad-cli: resolve from PATH (v10 verified; macOS: /Applications/KiCad.app/Contents/MacOS) — use for ERC, DRC, netlist export, BOM, Gerber, and `sch|pcb upgrade`
     Example: `kicad-cli sch erc file.kicad_sch --format json -o report.json`
   - Bulk parse script: `python3 -m src.pipeline.parse_project data/raw/project_name/`
